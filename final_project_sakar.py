It is typically attempted from varying distances on the field, depending on the team's position and the strategic decision made by the coaching staff. A successful field goal is worth three points and is often employed when a team is within kicking range but may face challenges scoring a touchdown. Executing a field goal requires precision from the kicker and coordination with the snapper and holder, making it a fundamental and strategic element of the game.
